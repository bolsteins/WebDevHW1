    <h1>Liepāja – my favorite place</h1>
    <h2>Why Liepāja?</h2>
    <p>Liepaja, Latvia, is a vibrant coastal city that has woven its way into the fabric of my fondest memories.</p>
    <p>As soon as I set foot in Liepaja, I'm greeted by the refreshing sea breeze and the sound of waves crashing against the shore. 
        The city's long stretches of sandy beaches invite me to wander along the coast, soaking in the panoramic views of the Baltic Sea.</p>

        The city's streets are lined with an eclectic mix of buildings, from elegant Art Nouveau masterpieces to charming wooden houses adorned with intricate carvings.
        Each corner reveals a piece of Liepaja's rich history, offering a glimpse into its storied past as a bustling port town.
        A guided tour is offered every Sunday. You can find out more about it <a href="https://liepaja.travel/darit-un-redzet/pastaigas-vecpilseta-gida-pavadiba/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
